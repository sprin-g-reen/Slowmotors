This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google). The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site. Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US. The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.

We use MailChimp, a service of The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA, hereinafter referred to as „The Rocket Science Group“.

In addition, your IP address and the date and time of your registration will be saved. During the registration process, your consent to receive this newsletter will be obtained together with a concrete description of the type of content it will offer and reference made to this privacy policy. The newsletter then sent out by The Rocket Science Group will also contain a tracking pixel called a web beacon.

                                To establish contact, the provider enables the customer, among other things, to make contact via the messenger service WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a service of WhatsApp Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland, hereinafter referred to as WhatsApp, a subsidiary of Facebook. When the user communicates with the provider via WhatsApp, both the provider and WhatsApp receive the mobile phone number of the user and the information that the user has contacted the provider. The abovementioned data are also forwarded by WhatsApp to Facebook servers in the USA and are processed by WhatsApp and Facebook in accordance with the WhatsApp privacy policy, which also includes processing for their own purposes, such as improving the WhatsApp service. _____________________ In the opinion of the data protection supervisory authorities, however, the USA does not currently have an adequate level of data protection. However, there are so-called standard contractual clauses: <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/about-standard-contractual-clauses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/about-standard-contractual-clauses</a> These are private law agreements, however, and therefore have no direct impact on the access options of the authorities in the USA. _____________________ More information about the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing of these data by WhatsApp and Facebook as well as related rights and setting options for protecting privacy are contained in privacy guidelines from WhatsApp: <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy</a>. The legal basis for this processing and the transmission to WhatsApp is Article 6 para. 1 clause 1 b. GDPR, insofar as the establishment of contact relates to an existing contractual relationship or serves to initiate such a contractual relationship. If contact is not made for the above purposes, the legal basis is Article 6 para.1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest of the provider is to improve the quality of service.
