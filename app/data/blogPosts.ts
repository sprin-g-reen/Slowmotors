<p class="mb-4">Planning your first motorcycle tour in India? First, pat yourself on the back. Then, tighten that helmet and open your heart to a nation where the rules of the road are more like gentle suggestions, and traffic flows like water—chaotic, unpredictable, but somehow always moving.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Here’s the thing most newcomers don’t realize: Indians are unconsciously hyper-aware on the road. They may not glance at the rear-view mirror. They may not hear your horn consciously. But their sixth sense is dialled in. They’re tuned to the frequency of chaos, always ready for a sudden swerve, a holy cow, or a rogue pedestrian mid-moonwalk. Assume anything could happen. Because it probably will.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As one very wise (and possibly tired) tyre brand once said: “The road is full of idiots.” And yet… everyone survives.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Because Indian traffic isn’t random — it’s a living organism. It breathes, pulses, and adapts. The trick is not to fight it, but to find the rhythm and flow with it. Once you do, riding here becomes not just manageable, but meditative. Sort of like surfing, but with cows.</p>
<p class="mb-4">So here it is: your no-fluff, full-truth, slightly cheeky guide to riding Indian roads — based on 100% lived experience.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1. Roads Have Lanes. Drivers Have... Imagination.</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Lane markings exist, but they’re treated like polite suggestions. Most drivers prefer the freestyle method — straddling two lanes, creating new ones, or following invisible GPS-guided spirit animals.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Stay flexible. Your lane is wherever your bike fits right now.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. The Horn is Your Turn Signal, Brake Light, and Social Icebreaker</h3>
<p class="mb-4">In India, everyone speaks Hornish. You honk to overtake. You honk to say hi. You honk because the sun is out. It’s less about warning and more about presence.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If your horn works, you exist. If it’s loud, you’re respected. If it’s musical, you’re a legend.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">3. Red Lights are Just... Suggestions. Polite Ones.</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Traffic lights are like parental advice: sometimes followed, sometimes ignored, always negotiable. At night, if there’s no cop around, it’s basically a roulette table. Foreign rider tip: Don’t be the lone soul stopping at a red while the whole city streams past you like a flood. Ride smart, not rigid.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">4. Cows are Road Royalty. Bow or Be Blessed Differently.</h3>
<p class="mb-4">A cow on the road is not a traffic problem. It’s a spiritual checkpoint. They lie down, ruminate, and command traffic like Zen masters. No horns, no rush — just quiet bovine judgement.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Bulls in particular have no chill. Avoid eye contact and ride around with humility.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">5. Pedestrians: India’s Final Boss Level</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Crosswalks? Optional. Logic? Fluid. Pedestrians will appear anywhere, often mid-road, mid-call, mid-biryani. Bonus points for crossing while pushing a cart full of jackfruit or carrying a ladder.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Stay alert for sudden movement — and sometimes, sudden stillness.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">6. Speed Breakers: India’s Space Launch Program</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Unmarked, oversized, and lovingly handcrafted — speed breakers here are more emotional than functional. Hit one too fast, and you’ll achieve temporary lift-off and spiritual awakening. Look for clues: a random pile of gravel, a slowing car ahead, or locals smiling with phones out.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">7. Overtaking: The National Pastime</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Who needs mirrors or clear lines of sight? Overtaking in India is done from left, right, sideways, or emotionally. You’ll often see three vehicles, a cow, and a wedding band attempting synchronized overtaking on a one-lane road. Smile and hold your line. The chaos will part around you.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">8. Night Riding: Choose Your Own Adventure (But Don’t)</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Many vehicles don’t use headlights. Others keep them on high beam. And some prefer stealth mode. Add stray dogs, potholes, fog, and temple processions… and you’ve got yourself a real-life horror game. Unless you absolutely have to, avoid night rides. Candlelit dinners are safer than candlelit highways.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">9. Rain = Instant Slip’n’Slide + Surprise Urban Planning</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Indian monsoons are magical — until they erase entire roads from existence. Tarmac vanishes. Potholes multiply like monsoon mushrooms. What was once a main road becomes a muddy memory. Repair timelines range from “we’re working on it” to “wait for next year’s budget.”</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">10. Road Signs Exist. Mostly for Decoration.</h3>
<p class="mb-4">“Drive Carefully.” “Don’t Drink and Drive.” “Better Late Than Never.” …all beautifully painted across rusted boards that no one reads. Most signs are obscured by trees, wires, or hopeful election posters.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Don’t rely on signage. Rely on the vehicle ahead of you. And maybe the cow.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">10½. Bonus: Mobile Offices, Now on Two Wheels</h3>
<p class="mb-4">You’ve heard of working from home. Now experience Working From Bike. Yes, we’ve seen techies taking Zoom calls from the pillion seat of a moving scooter, laptops out, AirPods in, typing away while dodging rickshaws. Multitasking Level: Indian IT. If someone seems distracted, they’re probably debugging a server while riding pillion to buy milk.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">But Seriously — Embrace the Chaos, Ride with Heart</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Riding in India is part theatre, part meditation, part video game. It may seem overwhelming at first, but with the right guidance — and a bit of surrender — it becomes something else entirely: flow.</p>
<p class="mb-4">At Slow Moto Tours, we make sure:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
<li>You’re briefed, not baffled</li>

<p class="mb-4">Pratish has been to Vietnam on the famous Ha Giang Loop and is sharing his impressions in this blog post.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The Ha Giang Loop in northern Vietnam is a dream route for any motorbike lover. For me, it was no different. After months of research, I finally embarked on this much-anticipated journey in April this year. The Ha Giang Loop offers a unique glimpse into Vietnam, far removed from the bustling cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As someone who manages the on-ground operations for Slow Moto Tours, this was more than just a personal adventure. It was an opportunity to observe and pick up tips from the Ha Giang tour experience. But more importantly, it allowed me to relax and enjoy the ride as a guest, without worrying about the logistics—a perspective that is invaluable for someone in the tour business.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The 3-day tour, covering about 300 kilometers, took us through some of the most breathtaking sceneries Vietnam has to offer—winding hilly roads, serene valleys, and rural villages. Our group comprised about 20 riders, with most opting for the pillion ride behind local drivers (the easy rider option), while a few chose to ride solo. Given that our luggage was tied behind the scooters, we all packed minimally, carrying only the essentials.</p>
<p class="mb-4">While the tour captain spoke English, the drivers’ limited English made communication challenging at times. On the second day, one of our bikes broke down in a remote location, with no immediate support available. Fortunately, with the help of some self-ride scooters in our group, we managed the situation, and a spare bike was arranged the next day. For accommodations, we stayed in local homestays with dormitory setups, which offered a closer connection to the local culture but lacked the privacy and comfort some might prefer.</p>
<p class="mb-4">By the end of the tour, I had made new friends and seen a side of Vietnam that would be impossible to experience as a typical tourist. While the Ha Giang Loop can be done in a four-wheeler, there’s nothing quite like doing it on a scooter or motorbike.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Our upcoming season kicks off with our first tour from October 28th to November 2nd, perfectly timed with Diwali, the festival of lights. This will be a unique experience for our guests as we ride through the stunning landscapes of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The carefully curated route, spanning about 500 kilometers, takes us through some of the best landscapes South India has to offer. We ride through quintessential Indian towns, navigate winding hill roads, and pass through rural villages, offering a diverse and immersive riding experience over four days.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
<li class="mb-2"><strong>Personalized Experience:</strong> We limit our group size to a maximum of 6 motorbikes (plus 2 for Jo and myself), ensuring each rider receives individual attention and guidance, creating a more intimate and enjoyable experience.</li>
<li class="mb-2"><strong>Cultural Immersion:</strong> During the ride, we take breaks to enjoy the authentic Indian energy drink, Chai, at local eateries, along with famous tea-time snacks. Our route is designed to immerse you in the local culture, away from the typical tourist trails.</li>
<li class="mb-2"><strong>Unique Accommodations:</strong> Our accommodations are carefully selected to offer a peaceful retreat after a day of riding. Whether it’s a beachside stay, a forest hideaway, or a plantation retreat, each location provides a unique and relaxing environment. You can unwind by taking a swim in the river or the swimming pool and indulge in lip-smacking local cuisine.</li>
<li class="mb-2"><strong>Comprehensive Support:</strong> Jo and I ride along with you on our motorbikes, accompanied by a service truck and a dedicated mechanic who are available for any support throughout the tour. This ensures that any unforeseen issues are handled swiftly, allowing you to focus on the ride and the experience.</li>
<li class="mb-2"><strong>Extended Relaxation:</strong> Our guests check in a day before the tour starts and check out a day after, giving them ample time to relax, acclimatize, and prepare for the journey ahead.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4">Exploring different landscapes on a motorbike offers a sense of freedom and adventure that few other experiences can match. Our tours in South India provide the perfect opportunity to discover this for yourself. We are excited to welcome you on our Diwali season tour and to share the beauty of southern India with you during this festive season.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We look forward to riding with you and making unforgettable memories on and off the road.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Did we work hard enough to ensure a flawless experience for our riders? And so, the moment arrived, and we embarked on our much-anticipated opening tour “The Roads to Chirakkal.”</p>
<p class="mb-4">Three Riders from Austria joined us for this test tour, marking a significant milestone.</p>
<p class="mb-4">After months of meticulous planning and preparations, this was our opportunity to fine-tune our offering based on their valuable feedback.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Prior to the actual start, our participants had the chance to acclimate themselves to the bikes and experience Indian traffic firsthand.</p>
<p class="mb-4">With our Riders by our side, we navigated Kochi on a sweltering afternoon. One of them had previous motorbike experience in Southeast Asia, while the other two were venturing into Asia for the first time. None of our Riders had ever ridden a motorbike in India, but they were braving the unique challenges of Indian traffic courageously.</p>
<p class="mb-4">At the start location, a beautiful beachside resort, our Enfield mechanic made final adjustments to the bikes, even customizing some settings to our Riders preferences. In the evening, we gathered for getting to know each other, discussing the routes and Indian road etiquette, and addressing any concerns our Riders had. Excitement filled the air as we looked forward to the start of the ride the following day, and everyone retired early to ensure a good night’s rest.</p>
<p class="mb-4">On a pleasant morning, we set off, with Jo leading the group and myself at the rear, accompanied by the service truck carrying our luggage, essential supplies and of course our mechanic.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Riding like this for the first time was something very special and you could feel everyone’s joy and excitement. We cruised hundreds of curves, climbed jungle mountains over countless hairpin bends, conquered the plains, and after the first five-day leg through this stunning scenery we arrived at Kannur, where we enjoyed a well-deserved rest day by the sea. The views of the Arabian Sea and enchanting sunsets were truly mesmerizing.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As we slowly made our way back down to Kochi after this break, we were even fortunate to spot elephants along the way. Although we encountered two minor defects on the bikes, our skilled mechanic handled them with ease and we were able to continue our ride without significant delays. Each evening, we engaged in dinner discussions, reflecting on the day’s ride and seeking ways to improve.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Writing this, I want to say a big thank you to our best ever “test customers” who not only constantly gave us their feedback but were fantastic companions on and off the road!</p>
<p class="mb-4">Overall, it was a very enriching experience and, above all, great fun. We witnessed our meticulous planning come to fruition while also identifying areas for improvement. Our riders left with cherished memories of their Indian adventure, instilling confidence in our Crew and our future endeavours.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Even before I could finish the question to our Riders and our Crew “If they would do it ag…?”, came the emphatic reply “YES!!!”</p>
<p class="mb-4">And personally, I can hardly wait until we hit the road again.</p>

        date: "Oct 15, 2022",
        excerpt: "In heavy rain and 14 degrees, we were riding our Enfields through the mountains to scout a route when a thought flashed through my mind for a brief second.",
        image: "https://slowmoto.tours/wp-content/uploads/Collage-01012023.webp",
        content: `
<p class="mb-4">“I´m going straight back to Kochi now and on the next plain home! I´m ready to give up now!”</p>
<p class="mb-4">A moment later I was laughing out loud about this surprise my mind offered me.</p>
<p class="mb-4">What a ridiculous thought. We didn’t come all this way for two years to be brought to our knees by a bit of bad weather. I immediately thought of Pratish, moving his bike only a few metres behind me through the pelting rain. Who had accompanied me for two uncertain years in the process of setting up our company and was now faithfully riding with me through this cold and wet hell.</p>
<p class="mb-4">During our last break, I had told him how much we Europeans can get upset about the weather and he looked at me rather uncomprehendingly and said that this was totally irrelevant because there was nothing we could do about it anyway. A very Indian way of thinking.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Since I had the idea for this venture two years ago, we have had to show so much patience and perseverance. The pandemic tied me to Vienna and even Pratish in India could not move around as freely as he would have liked. At least I was able to use the forced break to tinker with our website.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As soon as the travel restrictions allowed it, I wanted to go to India on a business visa. This was the only way I could have enough time to do all the tasks here. A tourist visa would not have been sufficient in terms of time. As it turned out later, only a business visa is valid as a proof of residence for me in India before the Indian authorities, in order to be able to sign further documents, e.g. to open our company account.</p>
<p class="mb-4">In order to get a business visa, however, I already had to be registered as a director of our company. So setting up the company had top priority.</p>
<p class="mb-4">This is how we started on the long road to founding a company in India with the participation of a European Citizen. It would certainly not have been easier the other way round. And it was always clear that our company had to be based in India in order to guarantee the best possible legal security for our future customers and also for us.</p>
<p class="mb-4">My initial naivety of being able to manage this company formation quickly and digitally on my own was brought down to bureaucratic reality by the complexity of the undertaking. Without a tax advisor in India to guide us through this process, nothing was going to happen. So Pratish found a tax advisor who was willing to take on the matter. And then he found the next tax advisor, because the first one had thrown in the towel due to excessive demands.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We now had a whole team in this office to help us and who kept on giving us new tasks on signatures and proof of identity.</p>
<p class="mb-4">In Vienna, I often went from notary to district court to provincial court to get the notarisation (and over-notarisation) of my signatures and proofs of identity and residence required by the Indian authorities.</p>
<p class="mb-4">I had an officially certified translation of my Austrian registration certificate done and over-certified, only to be told after submitting it to the Indian authorities that only my mobile phone bill would be accepted as proof of residence.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Again and again we were pushed back while our request became more and more urgent.</p>
<p class="mb-4">All the company incorporation data and the required attachments are submitted through a web portal. Now, at this very time, the Indian authorities decided to change this portal from a pdf-only submission to an AI-based system. For many weeks, a submission was simply not possible due to technical errors, which in turn almost drove our tax consulting team to despair.</p>
<p class="mb-4">This was because all documents had to be submitted at the same time for incorporation and could not be older than two months, which was not an easy thing to do in this process. In fact, my notarised and over-certified mobile phone invoice was then also older than two months again, but the authorities were accommodatingly content with the certifications on the old invoice plus the blank current invoice.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Suddenly, we could hardly believe our luck, the submission system seemed to work. And as I would not have expected anything else from an AI, only hours later in our email inboxes were the incorporation documents with which I could finally go to the Indian Embassy in Vienna and two weeks later had my business visa stuck in my passport.</p>
<p class="mb-4">So I have been in Kerala since October 2022 to put all the ideas of the past two years into practice. I’ll report on how we did in the next blog post.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Just so much in advance: everything is done, we have found the best routes (a dream come true for every rider), and secured the most beautiful accommodations. We are ready to go on an extraordinary journey with you!</p>
