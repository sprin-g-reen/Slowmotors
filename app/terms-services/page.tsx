                                Adequate travel insurance is mandatory for your tour with us and is not included in the price of the tour. For rider and pillion rider the insurance must cover holidays on motorcycles of 350ccm. Ensure that the travel insurance also covers you against cancellation charges, medical expenses during your holiday, unexpected curtailment of the holiday, emergency evacuation expenses, loss or damage to luggage & property and personal liability claims against you.

                                Our motorcycle insurance covers only material damage on the motorcycle caused due to any accident and material damage and personal injury caused to third parties with the legal usage of the motorcycle.

                                <li>60 days and more prior to Tour Start date: cancellation is free of charge and the amount of payments made up to that point, minus transaction costs, will be transferred back to you.</li>
                                <li>20 to 60 days prior to Tour Start date: you will get a refund of 50% of the package price minus transaction costs.</li>
                                <li>less than 20 days prior to Tour Start date or no show until 10:00 AM on Day Two: no refund.</li>

                                For a range of reasons – a broken collarbone, a family crisis or a suspended motorcycle licence – you may be forced to cancel your trip during our tour. In this case a refund will not be granted.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-4">
                                A special case is our individual custom tours: as we start with the preparations and reservations directly after we have received your payment, no refund claims can be granted.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Our cancellation</h3>
                            <p>
                                We reserve the right to cancel the tour if the minimum number of participants of three bikes is not reached up to 60 days prior to Tour Start date. In this case, the amount of payments made up to that point will be transferred back to you in full.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We might be forced to interrupt and/or shorten the tour due to local particularities that are out of our control. In South India – in particular in Kerala – political strikes might lockdown the state, or severe weather events make further riding impossible.
                                <br />
                                In this case, we will do everything in our power to ensure a speedy continuation of our ride, at least to reach the starting point again in time.
                                <br />
                                However, we disclaim all responsibility and liability should we not be able to proceed as planned with the tour. A refund of the purchase price, even only partially, is therefore not possible.
